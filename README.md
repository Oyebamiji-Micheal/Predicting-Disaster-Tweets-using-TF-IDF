## About the Project
<p align="justify">
<a href="https://quora.com/">Quora</a> is a platform that empowers people to learn from each other. On Quora, people can ask questions and connect with others who contribute unique insights and quality answers. <br />
This project is focused on predicting whether a given quora question is sincere or insincere. According to the data description on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/quora-insincere-questions-classification/data">Kaggle</a>, insincere questions are those founded upon false premises, or that intend to make a statement rather than look for helpful answers. Other characteristics that can signify that a question is insincere include:
</p>

- Has an exaggerated tone to underscore a point about a group of people
- Suggests a discriminatory idea against a protected class of people, or seeks confirmation of a stereotype
- Makes disparaging attacks/insults against a specific person or group of people
- Based on false information, or contains absurd assumptions
- Uses sexual content (incest, bestiality, pedophilia) for shock value, and not to seek genuine answers

and so on...

<p align="justify">
My objective is to utilize NLP techniques to process and analyze the textual question to create a predictive model that can classify questions as sincere or not to some level of accuracy. <br />
Part of my objective also include familiarizing myself with fundamental NLP concepts, including tokenization, lemmatization, stop words removal, stemming, TD-IDF, and so on. In addition, I aim to gain hands-on experience in applying NLP techniques to real-world text data and understanding their impact on model performance.
